# Alfred
A collection of snippits and workflows I use most with Alfred. 

### Snippits
* General stuff like arrows etc, I also have one for 'ttt'-'tweets' for the tweets workflow to speed things up.
* Email, all my email addresses I can get by just doing @ and then the first letter of the domain, also my usual email signoff.
* Some math notation.
* All the numbers as superscript and subscript and some letters as subscript.

### Workflows
I made none of these, all still have the authors attirbution in the files.
* timezone expander e.g "tz 1pm London ET PT" â†’  "1pm London / 8am ET / 5am PT"
  (see https://github.com/devonzuegel/timezone-expander.alfredworkflow for installation instructions)
* Google maps. Basically only use this in the form of "dir placeA to placeB" and this will open up google maps with a route from A to B.
* Lorem Ipsum. Generate loreum ipsum text/sentences/paragraphs.
* Twitter. This is the one I use most and I really only use the "tweets <query>" feature. This will search twitter for <query> but automatically put 
  the filter on to only search from people you follow. Makes social search very fast to do. (you will need to enter your username and twitterid 
  in the parameters)
